### Intro

I was tasked with investigating the relative effectiveness of several schools across various cross-sectional categories, including reading and math scores. I used Pandas and Numpy in a jupyter notebook running Python 3.


### Method & Results

Initially, I was given two csv datasets, which I merged. The resulting dataframe had unique Student ID keys, with the rest of the columns producing data that repeated vertically. I was tasked with creating a dataframe that neatly contained all of the most relevant summary information. Doing this required utilizing the int64 datatype, which can only be achieved with very specific syntax. Each of the series could then be combined into the requrested dataframe. 

For further details, please see the .ipynb file.
